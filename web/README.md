This is the back end and front end of the Pharos project. The back end is built with the Django frame work. The front
end is a mixture between Djangos template features and Vue.js. Roughly, the static parts and the parts which require a
close integration with Django are built on Django features. The more dynamic components such as maps and dynamic lists
are built with Vue.js
